### Project Description
Transform your boring professional resume into a comedy masterpiece! Upload your serious CV and watch our AI turn it into themed, humorous resumes for unconventional career paths like Coconut Climber or Pani Puri Entrepreneur.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Everyone's tired of looking at boring, professional resumes that actually make sense. Why should your resume be readable and relevant when it could be hilarious and completely unrelated to any real job? The world desperately needs more confusion in the hiring process!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI-powered resume destroyer that converts your serious professional experience into themed career disasters. Want to be a Coconut Climber? We'll turn your React skills into "React-ive Tree Climbing." Applied to be a Software Engineer? Nah, you're now a Toddy Tapper with expertise in "Natural Fermentation and Bug Debugging."
